            <b>Warm greetings</b> to all the stakeholders in the Placement
            Session of DCSA-PU - my beloved students, companies visiting the
            campus for recruitment drives, and the training and placement cell
            of the Institute facilitating the whole recruitment process. This
            stage is very crucial for the graduating students as they venture
            into a new phase of their life to fulfil their dream. I wish all the
            best to their journey.

            DCSA-PU, established in 1983, is very nourished with MCA, MSc-CS.
            The placement records of previous years are quite encouraging with
            continuous improvement over the years. The young and vibrant faculty
            members of the Institute have made sure that adequate knowledge is
            imparted to the students, making them ready to pick up the
            technological and management challenges in their career. With the
            kind of grooming we give our students in both theory and practical
            aspects of their curriculum, I am sure that frontier companies in
            the domain of Information Technology will be highly interested in
            recruiting them. In the broader picture, I see this as an overall
            development in terms of socio-technical growth in our country.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In this background, I would like to invite all the corporates
            involved in the domain of Information Technology to visit DCSA-PU
            and recruit our students.
